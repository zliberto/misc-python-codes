# Miscellaneous Python Codes

This repository contains all Jupyter Notebooks I created as a part of a UIC course titled "Programming for Data Science" (IDS 400). It contains course assignments, exams and labs. They cover a wide variety of Python programming concepts and data science and data manipulation packages (Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, etc.)
